   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to DDF's documentation!
===============================

Django Dynamic Fixture (DDF) is a complete and simple library to create **dynamic model instances** for **testing purposes**.

It lets you **focus on your tests**, instead of focusing on generating some dummy data which is boring and pollutes the test source code.

It exists to solve the **anti-pattern** of Static Fixtures and Factory objects. Are you tired to maintain dozens of yml/json files and factory objects?
